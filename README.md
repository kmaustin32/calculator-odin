Current list of features and bux fixes to be applied.

- Fix delete key when there is no current value.

- Make sure pressing "=" doesn't break the calculator when there is either no current or last value. 

- Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… and don’t let it crash your calculator!
-- Maybe do this as a stand along function that can be envoked before calculate on press. Call it something like "checkZero".

- Change the style and animation on the del key.
